**Vampirism API Mod Example**
======================================

This is just an example for a mod that can interact with Vampirism's API if Vampirism is installed.
It also runs if Vampirism is not installed.
I created it to test the system and then thought, why not upload it as an example.

This example mod always requires Vampirism to be installed. Check out the other examples for mod compatiblity examples.
Vampirism's API is declared as optional dependency in the build.gradle file. Adjust it to use the latest version.
It will be downloaded automatically when setting up your workspace.

Same as the MDK or most other mods. You can check out the guide in the Vampirism repository.
